## [cypress-intro](https://github.com/Beamanator/cairo-codes-projects/tree/master/cypress-intro)

This is a basic React application, with `cypress` installed, where we added a few basic Cypress tests to get a feel for the library.

Remember, `cypress` is not written with React or Svelte code, it's purely Javascript, with methods from its own library.

## [cypress-intro-svelte](https://github.com/Beamanator/cairo-codes-projects/tree/master/cypress-intro-svelte)

This is a basic Svelte application, with `cypress` installed. There is only one Cypress test for now, which came directly from the tutorial on the Cypress site. Feel free to play around with this (as it is homework!)
