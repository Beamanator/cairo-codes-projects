## [cypress-intro](https://github.com/Beamanator/cairo-codes-projects/tree/master/cypress-intro)

This is a basic React application, with `cypress` installed, where we added a few basic Cypress tests to get a feel for the library.

Remember, `cypress` is not written with React or Svelte code, it's purely Javascript, with methods from its own library.
